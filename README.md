# computer-security-projects

This repository is used to record my assignments for computer security (ECE568) course. Each assignment is in a seperate folder. 

We mainly exploited buffer overflow, format string, double free vulnerabilities to attack in the assignment 1.

And we studied and implemented two methods for two-factor authentication in assignment 2, including Time-based One Time Password (TOTP) and Biometric Multi-Factor Authentication.

In assignment 3, we explore the WebGoat website and attack some common web vulnerabilities there, including Reflected XSS Attacks, Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF), CSRF Token By-Pass, SQL Injection, and so on.

At last, we implement DNS cache poisoning attack in assignment 4.
